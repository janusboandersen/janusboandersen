### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- :rocket: See my resume [here](https://github.com/janusboandersen/resume).
- ðŸ”­  Electronics and embedded software engineer as well as M.Sc. in Finance and Economics, with 10 years work and project experience from an industry-leading pharma company and from the banking sector.
- âš¡ I'm Danish with Singaporean PR. Relocating to Denmark in August 2023.
- ðŸŒ±  I enjoy working on things like
  - __Electronics and FPGAs__, e.g.
    - __PCBAs for quantum technology__, ranging from power adaptors to RF. Contact me for further details (proprietary tech).
    - __Machine learning acceleration on SoC__, e.g. using Xilinx Zynq-7000. See for example [this project](https://github.com/janusboandersen/machine-learning-on-soc) developing HW accelerated KNN.
    - __Logic synthesis__, e.g. [this project](https://github.com/janusboandersen/boolean_calculator).

  - __Computer vision and robotics__, e.g.
    - __Robotics and Vision-based automated testing__ of physical products. Contact me for further details (proprietary tech).
    - __3D computer vision__. See e.g. [this project](https://github.com/janusboandersen/3d-computer-vision) covering 3D reconstruction from two views and depth-based segmentation.
    - __Quadrotor drone control systems__. See e.g. [this project](https://github.com/janusboandersen/dynamic-control-systems) exploring dynamics and controls, and currently working on a separate ROS implementation to control a Parrot Mambo drone.
  
- __Systems integration__, e.g.
  - __Smart metering system and IOT__. See e.g. [this project](https://github.com/E5PRO5-2020/meter_system) developing a system to monitor and decrypt a Kamstrup energy meter over WM-Bus, parsing and sending the data to a Cloud system.
- Many other fun things... Take a look around my Github and get in touch with me.
